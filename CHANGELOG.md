This changelog represents a significant evolution of the project, transforming it from a collection of scripts into a cohesive, modular application with enhanced features and improved user experience.

## **v9.0.0**
- **Playwright Integration Finalized**: Completely replaced Selenium with Playwright for faster and more reliable JavaScript handling during web scraping.
- **Dynamic Content Support**: Improved handling of dynamic content such as infinite scroll and cookie banners to ensure more comprehensive content extraction.
- **Gradio Interface Enhancements**: Added a real-time progress bar and success/failure statistics in the Gradio UI, improving user experience and monitoring capabilities.
- **Data Processing with Pandas**: Incorporated Pandas to process and display scraping results, providing a summary of successes and failures.

## **v8.0.0**
- **Playwright Introduction**: Introduced Playwright as an alternative to Selenium for better performance when handling JavaScript-heavy pages.
- **Enhanced File Handling**: Improved file-saving methods, ensuring unique filenames for dynamic URLs and better handling of query parameters.
- **User Feedback Improvements**: Further enhancements to the Gradio interface, allowing better real-time feedback and monitoring during scraping tasks.
- **JavaScript Detection**: Added functionality to log and handle pages requiring JavaScript, skipping them when necessary.

## **v7.0.0**
- **Selenium Improvements**: Enhanced Seleniumâ€™s ability to interact with pages requiring JavaScript, including handling infinite scroll to ensure all content is fully loaded.
- **Clean HTML Extraction**: Improved the `clean_html()` function by including removal of non-essential HTML elements like headers, footers, and navigation menus.
- **Gradio UI Introduced**: Integrated Gradio to provide a graphical interface for starting the scraper and viewing results, with options for user uploads.

## **v6.0.0**
- **Selenium with Threading**: Implemented multi-threaded execution using `ThreadPoolExecutor` alongside Selenium for faster scraping of JavaScript-heavy websites.
- **Optimized Gradio Interface**: Further refined the Gradio interface with better scraping options for users.
- **Performance Upgrades**: Added random delays between requests to reduce server load and mimic human browsing patterns.

## **v5.0.0**
- **Selenium Integration**: Initial integration of Selenium for scraping JavaScript-rendered pages, providing a foundation for scraping modern web pages.
- **Rate Limiting with AsyncLimiter**: Introduced rate limiting to ensure requests are spaced out properly, preventing overload on target websites.
- **Retry Logic with Backoff**: Implemented retry logic using exponential backoff to handle transient network errors more gracefully.
- **Gradio Interface**: Added the first version of the Gradio web interface to launch scraping tasks through a browser-based interface.

## **v4.0.0**
- **HTML Content Cleaning**: Introduced a more sophisticated `clean_html()` function, which removes unnecessary HTML elements (e.g., scripts, styles) from the scraped content.
- **Filename Generation Improvements**: Enhanced the `generate_filename()` function to handle complex URL paths and query parameters, using hashing for uniqueness.
- **Improved Error Handling**: Better error reporting and retry mechanisms for handling request failures more effectively.

## **v3.0.0**
- **Logging and Output**: Reduced logging verbosity to `INFO` to focus on key events like progress and errors.
- **Rich Library Integration**: Introduced the use of the `rich` library for better logging and output formatting, providing clearer progress updates and summaries.
- **Retry Mechanism**: Added retry logic with exponential backoff to handle network issues and transient failures.

## **v2.0.0**
- **Basic Scraper Implementation**: Initial release of the scraper with asynchronous URL fetching using `aiohttp` and basic HTML cleaning.
- **Concurrency and Rate Limiting**: Added basic concurrency control and rate limiting with `AsyncLimiter` to prevent overwhelming servers.
- **File Saving Mechanism**: Implemented functionality to save cleaned text content into files, ensuring the filenames are sanitized based on URL paths.
